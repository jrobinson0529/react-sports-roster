# Sports Roster
This is the first full CRUD React application that I developed. It is a card based team roster builder where you can add, update, delete, create and read cards based on basketball. Full CRUD in React. EXCITING!!!

### User stories
- As a user I will land on the 'Home' view where I will be promted to log in to be able to interact with the site.
- After logging in I can see my roster as well as a sign out button and a button to open the new player form.
- I can delete my roster cards or edit them individually.
- With the form I can create a new player to add to the roster and give it all the relevant data.
